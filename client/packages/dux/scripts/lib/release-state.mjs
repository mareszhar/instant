/**
 * The in-flight release record (dux-spec-workspace.md §6.2).
 *
 * A release is publish-then-orchestrate: once `@mszr/idb-dux@<v>` is on npm the
 * bump is permanent and the remaining steps (demo prep + commit, deploy, public
 * subtree) must still happen. If one of them fails, the maintainer re-runs the
 * same `publish:sdk:<type>` and the orchestrator resumes from the first
 * incomplete step instead of re-doing — or worse, re-bumping — what's done.
 *
 * The record is the single source of truth for "where did this release get to".
 * It lives in the gitignored scratch dir and is cleared once the release lands.
